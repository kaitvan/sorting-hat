# Sorting Hat Project
The user clicks a "Let's start sorting!" button to open up a form to enter a first-year student's name. Upon submitting the student's name, the student is sorted into a house and a card with their name and house is printed on the screen. The user can expel a student by clicking a button on the student's card.
